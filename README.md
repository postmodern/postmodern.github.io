# What?

This is my [site](http://postmodern.github.io/). The site provides a blog
and a current list of my projects.

# Why?

I commit something to GitHub almost everyday. So I thought, why not commit
blog posts?

Also, WordPress is full of bugs.

# How?

* [Jekyll](http://tom.preston-werner.com/jekyll/) - it is a nice static site
  generator.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
